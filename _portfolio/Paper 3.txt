title: "Tax Sentiment and Compliance: Evidence from Social Media"
excerpt: '**Coauthors:** Andrew Belnap, Jake Thornock, and Brady Williams<br/> **Revise and Resubmit:** The Accounting Review<br/> **Abstract:** Motivations for voluntary tax compliance that fall outside of a standard, rational model can be intrinsic or extrinsic. We use social media rhetoric about taxes to create a measure of tax sentiment that reflects taxpayers’ extrinsic, behavioral motivations for voluntary compliance, and then examine the association between public tax sentiment and tax compliance. Our machinelearning based approach for measuring sentiment uses millions of tax-related tweets, which vary by time and geography. We find that tax sentiment is negatively associated with tax compliance. Our main findings and cross-sectional tests are consistent with the notion that paying one’s taxes is a way to disassociate one’s social identity from the tax evasion, inequity, and waste that are often the target of negative social ire. Overall, our study provides key insights on the evolution of tax-related discourse on social media and its association with tax compliance.'
