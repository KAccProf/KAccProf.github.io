excerpt: '**Revise and Resubmit: Journal of Accounting and Economics**<br/> **Abstract:** Do firms provide adequate, timely, and transparent reporting on impending contingent litigation losses? Despite intense regulatory debate, related empirical evidence is sparse, dated, and lacks empirical identification. We use a hand-collected sample of firm disclosures together with novel legal dates to empirically identify conformity with the probability and estimability conditions of ASC 450. This innovation allows us to distinguish what should be reported from what is reported. Contrary to regulatorsâ€™ expressed optimism, our findings suggest that current reporting of litigation losses is inadequate, untimely, and lacks transparency. In a high-powered setting where losses are unambiguously material, probable, and estimable, we find that roughly one sixth of firms fail to observably report accruals or estimated losses. Further, we find that less than 10% of material litigation losses are reported in advance of preliminary lawsuit resolution. Additionally, more than half of disclosures lack transparency about the underlying accounting treatment. Finally, our evidence suggests that legal contingency reporting is insensitive to a dramatic shift in the probability of litigation losses but highly sensitive to changes in estimability. Our results imply that managers overwhelmingly report contingent liabilities more like regular liabilities, waiting to report until contingent losses are nearly certain and precisely quantified.'
