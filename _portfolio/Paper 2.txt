title: "Estimating Profitability Decomposition Frameworks via Machine Learning: Implications for Earnings Forecasting and Financial Statement Analysis"
excerpt: '**Revise and Resubmit: Journal of Accounting and Economics**<br/> **Abstract:** We find that nonlinear estimation of profitability decomposition frameworks yields more accurate out-of-sample profitability forecasts than forecasts from a random walk and linear estimation. The improvements derive from nonlinear estimation and synergies between nonlinear estimation and profitability decomposition frameworks. We analyze three essential financial statement analysis design choices to provide insights for the teaching and practice of fundamental analysis and find robust evidence that higher levels of decomposition and focusing on core items improve forecast accuracy, and mixed evidence supporting the use of a long series of historical information. The benefits are pronounced for firms with extreme profitability levels and during the growth, maturity, decline, and shakeout stages of firmsâ€™ lifecycles. We find that our forecasts predict returns and profitability changes before and after controlling for analyst forecasts and state-of-the-art asset pricing factors.'
